## Logout Redirect lets you choose exactly where users are sent when they log out.

By default, when a user logs off your site they are directed to the WordPress branded login screen.

## Usage


For help with installing plugins please refer to our [Plugin installation guide](https://wpmudev.com/docs/using-wordpress/installing-wordpress-plugins/). Once installed login to your admin panel for WordPress or Multisite and activate the plugin:

*   On regular WordPress installs – visit **Plugins** and **Activate** the plugin.
*   For WordPress Multisite installs – Activate it blog-by-blog (say if you wanted to make it a Pro Sites plugin), or visit **Network Admin -> Plugins** and **Network Activate** the plugin.

_Please Note:_

*   _Not compatible with BuddyPress_

### To Use on WordPress Multisite:

When network-activated on a WordPress multisite install, head on over to **Network Admin --> Settings --> Network Settings** and add the URL in the text field labeled "_Logout Redirect_"

### To Use on individual WordPress sites:

If you have installed the Logout Redirect plugin on a single site install of WordPress, or have activated it blog-by-blog in a multisite install, simply head to **Settings --> General** in the site's wp-admin, and add the URL in the text field labeled "Logout Redirect".

 Thats it, your all setup and ready to go! And now instead of seeing the standard WordPress login screen: 

![Login Screen](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/CowPat.Net-›-Log-In.jpg "Login Screen")

You've redirected them to a much more useful page of your choosing such as your network homepage, your help and support site, or wherever you would like. In our example, they've been redirected to Edublogs.
